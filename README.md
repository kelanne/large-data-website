# Scotch and Whiskey

Fungi are amazingly varied and beautiful (and ugly) to look at. The different species, colours, shapes, and sizes are very inspiring.

## Purpose

This project is a school project to learn about making design systems for large-scale websites.

Iâ€™m excited to learn about using Git and GitHub in a classroom setting.
