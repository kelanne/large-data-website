			<p>The Lowlands produces gentle, light whiskies, often very dry and devoid of peat. Lowland whiskies are commonly referenced as feminine drams, the <i>Lowland Ladies</i>. Most of the whisky regions of Scotland, and indeed the world, there can be some crossover. For example, it is quite possible to produce a heavily peated whisky outside of Islay or the Highlands, simply distilling peated barley can facilitate that.</p> <br>

			<p>The Lowlands is different in this respect, where the method of production differs; Lowland whiskies are triple distilled. Though this does occur elsewhere - of course, Springbank triple distils Hazelburn - it is best known and most commonly practised further south. The region is bordered by the Highland Line to the north and sits neatly atop England. There is no peat used and there is not a great deal of local peat. There is little salinity in the whisky, for the operating Lowland distilleries are all sited inland. Auchentoshan is quite possibly the best known. The Rosebank and St Magdalene distilleries have produced delightful whiskies.</p> <br>
