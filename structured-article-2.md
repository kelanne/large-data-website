Scotch That Isn't Smoky

Sub-title: Four bottles that prove "peaty" is the most overrated characteristic of scotch

**The was Scotch drinkers** light up when you say "peat" these days, you'd think it was some sort of tropical fruit of almost magical deliciousness rather than — as W. A. Kerr defined it in his 1905 magnum opus, Peat and its Products — "a spongy vegetable substance composed generally of mosses and aquatic plants in different states of decomposition." For many Scotch drinkers, the smoky muskiness it gives a whisky has become the drink's defining characteristic rather than the quality of distillation or how well it's matured. Yet, ironically, the doughty Scots who first introduced peat to firewater did so only because they didn't have any other choice. If not for peat, they wouldn't have had any whisky at all.

To make malt whisky, you need malt, which is made by toasting just-sprouted barley. Most of the Highlands being remote, treeless subarctic moorland, that toasting had to come from the only fuel they had: dried peat. And peat is about as smoky as a fuel can get. (Indeed, the distinctive aroma of burning peat pervades many Scottish and Irish country towns to this day.) Since the flavor of smoke is impossible to distill out, early Scotch whisky was redolent with it.

Most Scotch whisky, that is. In the industrialized southern Lowlands, they had plenty of hard coal, which produces a light, almost odorless smoke. Once the 20th century rolled around and modern transport reached all but the remotest parts of the Highlands, distillers could bring in Lowland-style unpeated malt or indeed malt smoked to any level they wanted. Nowadays, very few producers outside the peat-bound island of Islay use more than a small proportion of smoked malt in their whiskies, opting rather to use it as an accent. There are, however, even fewer that go bareback and use none at all.

Taste the 10-year-old [2] Glengoyne malt ($46) from the southern edge of the Highlands, just north of Glasgow, and you might just wonder why any distiller would still use peat. While a big peated single malt such as a Bowmore from Islay or a Springbank from Campbeltown is inarguably a magnificent whisky, they can't do what this does. The Glengoyne is like pure distilled honey — soft, creamy, harmonious. Or try the new Rocks bottling from Islay's [1]Bruichladdich distillery ($45), which, unlike most of its neighbors on that peat-rich island, specializes in whiskies made from unpeated grain. It's brinier, less ingratiating than the Glengoyne, with hints of tropical fruit and butterscotch. And yet there's also a hint of something that's not supposed to be there: While it's not smoky, there's nonetheless an unmistakable whiff of peat.

Peat, you see, has another way of sneaking into your glass. Malt whisky is made of three things: barley malt, yeast, and water. And since much of the Highlands is occupied by peat bogs, the groundwater is often percolated through the stuff to the point that it comes out of the tap with a brownish tint. Most peated-malt whiskies are thus essentially double peated via the smoked grain and the funky water, and many an ostensibly unpeated whisky still betrays its influence, sometimes markedly. Take the [3]Tobermory 15 ($69) from the western island of Mull: a rich, complex whisky — dark and chewy yet not heavy or overpowering, with a "Scotchiness" from the peaty water. Contrast that with the [4] Auchentoshan18 ($110), which is from the Lowlands, near Glasgow, and has no discernible peatiness, allowing this rich yet subtle old whisky to present itself almost like a bourbon: grainy, with all kinds of spice notes from the barrels in which it slumbered for so long — mocha, leather, a hundred other things — and a long, smooth finish. Peat in the water would hide the subtlety, and smoke would smother it entirely. Without them, you have malt whisky in its purest form — something that, no matter how peaty you like your Scotch, is well worth getting to know.
