Poor Man's Scotch
---
Sub-title: Where beer and whiskey meet.

**Fine, fine, it's not scotch** It's not even whiskey. It's beer. But it's damned fine beer. Scottish brewery Innis & Gunn is the first major brewery to age its ale in American white-oak barrels, the same kind used for Scotch. The result is a honey-colored thing that smells like vanilla and toffee and has little champagne-like bubbles. Here's how it happened: Back in 2002, whiskey maker William Grant & Sons was looking to season some barrels for an ale-finished Scotch. The plan was to produce and store beer in oak barrels to flavor the wood, then dump the stuff. But distiller Mike Webber just couldn't bring himself to waste all those drinkable suds, so he partook--and he was blown away. A year later he helped found Innis & Gunn Brewing Company. The ale is now hitting U. S. shelves. And at $5 to $10 per 12-ounce bottle, we sure as hell couldn't have called it poor man's beer.
