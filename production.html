				<h2 id="singlebarrel">Single Barrel</h2>
				<p>Single barrel whiskey (or single cask whisky) is a premium class of whisky in which each bottle comes from an individual aging barrel, instead of being created by blending together the contents of various barrels to provide uniformity of color and taste. Even whiskeys that are not blends may be combined from more than one batch, or even from differing years to achieve their consistency. </p>

				<h2 id="grain">Grain</h2>
				<p>Grain whisky ordinarily refers to any whisky made (at least in part) from grains other than malted barley, such as whisky made using maize (corn), wheat or rye. Grain whiskies can also contain some malted barley. Whisky made from only malted barley (or primarily from malted barley) is typically called malt whisky rather than grain whisky (although barley is a grain). Most American whiskeys and Canadian whiskeys are grain-based.</p>

				<h2 id="blended">Blended</h2>
				<p>Blended Scotch is simply a mix of malt and grain whiskies. Some blends use a limited number of malts, around a dozen (The Famous Grouse and Bailie Nicol Jarvie are examples); others, many more: around 40 malts go into Johnnie Walker Black Label and Ballantines. </p>

				<h2 id="singlemalt">Single Malt</h2>
				<p>Single Malt Scotch is single malt whisky made in Scotland using a pot still distillation process at a single distillery, with malted barley as the only grain ingredient. As with any Scotch whisky, a single malt Scotch must be distilled in Scotland and matured in oak casks in Scotland for at least three years (most single malts are matured longer).</p>
